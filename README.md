# -Flow Chapter 1 HAPPINESS REVISITED
# -《心流》第一章 重新审视幸福

##  -成功，就像幸福一样，是无法追求的
We cannot reach happiness by consciously searching for it. “Ask yourself whether you are happy,” said J. S. Mill, “and you cease to be so.” It is by being fully involved with every detail of our lives, whether good or bad, that we find happiness, not by trying to look for it directly. Viktor Frankl, the Austrian psychologist, summarized it beautifully in the preface to his book Man’s Search for Meaning: “Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue…as the unintended side-effect of one’s personal dedication to a course greater than oneself.”

我们无法通过有意识地寻找幸福而获得幸福。"密尔（J. S. Mill）说：“问你自己是否幸福，你就不会再幸福了。”正是通过充分参与我们生活的每一个细节，无论是好的还是坏的，我们才找到了幸福，而不是通过直接寻找幸福才获得幸福。奥地利心理学家维克多·弗兰克尔（Viktor Frankl）在他的《人类对意义的探索》一书的序言中对此作了很好的总结：“不要瞄准成功，你越是瞄准它，把它作为目标，你就越是会错过它。因为成功，就像幸福一样，是无法追求的；它必须是......作为个人致力于比自己更伟大的事业所产生的意外的副产品。”


##  -单纯享乐不能获得最优体验
Contrary to what we usually believe, moments like these, the best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times—although such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. The swimmer’s muscles might have ached during his most memorable race, his lungs might have felt like exploding, and he might have been dizzy with fatigue—yet these could have been the best moments of his life. Getting control of life is never easy, and sometimes it can be definitely painful. But in the long run optimal experiences add up to a sense of mastery—or perhaps better, a sense of participation in determining the content of life—that comes as close to what is usually meant by happiness as anything else we can conceivably imagine.

与我们通常认为的相反，我们生命中最好的时刻，并不是被动的、接受的、放松的时刻，尽管这样的经历也可以是愉快的，如果我们努力地去实现它们。最好的时刻通常发生在一个人的身体或思想为了完成困难和有价值的事情而自愿努力达到极限之时。在游泳运动员最难忘的比赛中，他的肌肉可能会疼痛，肺部可能会感到爆炸，也可能会因疲劳而头晕，然而这些体验可能是他生命中最美好的时刻。掌控生活从来都不是一件容易的事，有时肯定会很痛苦。但从长远来看，最优体验加起来会形成一种掌控感，或者也许更好，一种参与决定生活内容的感觉，这种感觉比起我们可以想象到的任何其他事物来说，更接近通常意义上的幸福。


##  -心流的定义
I developed a theory of optimal experience based on the concept of flow—the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.

我在 "心流 "的概念基础上发展了一种最佳体验的理论。在这种状态下，人们非常投入一项活动，其他的事情似乎都不重要了；这种体验本身是如此令人愉快，以至于人们即使付出巨大的代价，也会为了做这件事而做下去。


##  -被欲望驱使的渴求状态无法填满
There are literally thousands of such volumes in print or on the remainder shelves of book-stores, explaining how to get rich, powerful, loved, or slim. Like cookbooks, they tell you how to accomplish a specific, limited goal on which few people actually follow through. Yet even if their advice were to work, what would be the result afterward in the unlikely event that one did turn into a slim, well-loved, powerful millionaire? Usually what happens is that the person finds himself back at square one, with a new list of wishes, just as dissatisfied as before. What would really satisfy people is not getting slim or rich, but feeling good about their lives. In the quest for happiness, partial solutions don’t work. However well-intentioned, books cannot give recipes for how to be happy. Because optimal experience depends on the ability to control what happens in consciousness moment by moment, each person has to achieve it on the basis of his own individual efforts and creativity. 

时下书店里有上千本书教人如何致富、夺权、求爱或减肥，它们像食谱一样，教你一步步走向某个狭隘的目标，但很少有人能真正贯彻到底。即使这些方法真的管用，能够让你变得身材苗条、人见人爱、有钱有势那又如何呢？通常你会发现自己又回到了起点，有了一连串新的愿望，和以前一样不满意。真正让人满意的不是变得苗条或富有，而是对自己的生活感觉良好。在追求幸福的过程中，局部的解决方案是行不通的。无论多么用心良苦，书籍都不能提供如何获得幸福的配方。因为最佳体验取决于控制意识中每时每刻发生的事情的能力，每个人都必须依靠自身的努力和创造力来获得最佳体验。

In a complex society, many powerful groups are involved in socializing, sometimes to seemingly contradictory goals. On the one hand, official institutions like schools, churches, and banks try to turn us into responsible citizens willing to work hard and save. On the other hand, we are constantly cajoled by merchants, manufacturers, and advertisers to spend our earnings on products that will produce the most profits for them. 

在一个复杂的社会中，许多强大的集团都参与了社会化，有时是为了看似矛盾的目标。一方面，学校、教堂和银行等官方机构试图把我们变成愿意努力工作和储蓄的负责任的公民。另一方面，我们不断受到商人、制造商和广告商的劝诱，把我们的收入花在能为他们带来最大利润的产品上。


##  -如何克服现代生活的焦虑与沮丧?
To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments. To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. She has to develop the ability to find enjoyment and purpose regardless of external circumstances. This challenge is both easier and more difficult than it sounds: easier because the ability to do so is entirely within each person’s hands; difficult because it requires a discipline and perseverance that are relatively rare in any era, and perhaps especially in the present. And before all else, achieving control over experience requires a drastic change in attitude about what is important and what is not. 

要克服现代生活的焦虑与沮丧，必须独立于社会环境，不再完全以社会环境的奖惩为念。为了实现这种自主性，一个人必须学会奖励自己，必须发展出一种能力，不管外部环境如何，都能找到乐趣和目的。这一挑战比听起来更容易也更困难：更容易是因为这样做的能力完全在每个人的手中；更困难是因为它需要一种纪律和毅力，这在任何时代都是比较罕见的，也许在目前尤其如此。最重要的是，要实现对体验的控制，需要在对重要和不重要事物的态度上发生巨大转变。

We grow up believing that what counts most in our lives is that which will occur in the future. Parents teach children that if they learn good habits now, they will be better off as adults. Teachers assure pupils that the boring classes will benefit them later, when the students are going to be looking for jobs. The company vice president tells junior employees to have patience and work hard, because one of these days they will be promoted to the executive ranks. At the end of the long struggle for advancement, the golden years of retirement beckon. “We are always getting to live,” as Ralph Waldo Emerson used to say, “but never living.” Or as poor Frances learned in the children’s story, it is always bread and jam tomorrow, never bread and jam today. 

我们在成长过程中相信，我们生活中最重要的是将来会发生的事情。父母教导孩子，如果他们现在养成了好习惯，他们在成年后就会有更好的发展。老师向学生们保证，枯燥的课程会让他们以后在找工作时受益。公司副总经理告诉底层员工要有耐心，努力工作，因为总有一天他们会被提拔升职。在漫长的晋升斗争结束时，退休的黄金岁月在向他们招手。正如拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生（Ralph Waldo Emerson）常说的那样：“我们总是在为生活做准备，却从来没有真正生活。” 或者正如可怜的弗朗西斯在孩子们的故事中学到的那样，明天永远有面包和果酱，而今天永远没有面包和果酱。

Of course this emphasis on the postponement of gratification is to a certain extent inevitable. As Freud and many others before and after him have noted, civilization is built on the repression of individual desires. It would be impossible to maintain any kind of social order, any complex division of labor, unless society’s members were forced to take on the habits and skills that the culture required, whether the individuals liked it or not. Socialization, or the transformation of a human organism into a person who functions successfully within a particular social system, cannot be avoided. The essence of socialization is to make people dependent on social controls, to have them respond predictably to rewards and punishments. And the most effective form of socialization is achieved when people identify so thoroughly with the social order that they no longer can imagine themselves breaking any of its rules.

当然，这种对推迟满足的强调在某种程度上是不可避免的。正如弗洛伊德和其他心理学家所指出的，文明是建立在对个人欲望的压抑之上的。除非社会成员被迫接受文化所要求的习惯和技能，否则就不可能维持任何一种社会秩序，任何复杂的劳动分工，无论个人是否喜欢这样。社会化，可以理解为“将一个人的有机体转变为一个在特定社会系统中成功运作的人”，这是无法避免的。社会化的本质是让人们依赖社会控制，让他们对奖励和惩罚作出可预测的反应。而最有效的社会化形式是当人们完全认同社会秩序，以至于他们不再能想象自己会违反其中的任何规则。

Though the evidence suggests that most people are caught up on this frustrating treadmill of rising expectations, many individuals have found ways to escape it. These are people who, regardless of their material conditions, have been able to improve the quality of their lives, who are satisfied, and who have a way of making those around them also a bit more happy. Such individuals lead vigorous lives, are open to a variety of experiences, keep on learning until the day they die, and have strong ties and commitments to other people and to the environment in which they live. They enjoy whatever they do, even if tedious or difficult; they are hardly ever bored, and they can take in stride anything that comes their way. Perhaps their greatest strength is that they are in control of their lives. 

虽然各种证据表明，大多数人会陷入期望值不断升高的恶性循环中无力自拔，但还是有不少人能逃脱出来。这些人尽管物质条件不够优越，但仍然能改善生活品质，不但知足常乐，也常能使周遭的人生活得更快乐。这种人充满活力，愿意接纳各式各样的经历，活到老学到老，而且对别人及周遭的环境有强烈的责任感。不论多么烦琐艰难的工作，他们都能甘之如饴；他们从不厌倦，能轻易克服任何难题。他们最大的长处就是，对自己的生活掌控自如。
